/**
 * DEBUGGING GUIDE FOR GOOGLE APPS SCRIPT
 * 
 * If your Google Apps Script is not receiving data from your form, try these steps:
 * 
 * 1. Check the script logs:
 *    - In the Apps Script editor, go to View > Logs
 *    - Submit a test form and check if any logs appear
 * 
 * 2. Test the script directly:
 *    - Add this test function to your Apps Script
 *    - Run it manually from the Apps Script editor
 *    - Check if it adds a test entry to your sheet
 */

function testAddToSheet() {
  try {
    var ss = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();
    var sheet = ss.getSheetByName('Waitlist') || ss.insertSheet('Waitlist');
    
    if (sheet.getLastRow() === 0) {
      sheet.appendRow(['Email', 'Timestamp', 'Source']);
    }
    
    sheet.appendRow(['test@example.com', new Date().toISOString(), 'Test Script']);
    
    Logger.log('Test entry added successfully');
  } catch (error) {
    Logger.log('Error in test: ' + error.toString());
  }
}

/**
 * COMMON ISSUES AND SOLUTIONS:
 * 
 * 1. Sheet name mismatch:
 *    - Your script is looking for a sheet named 'Waitlist'
 *    - Your actual sheet might be named differently
 *    - Solution: Change the sheet name in the script or rename your sheet
 * 
 * 2. Permission issues:
 *    - The script might not have permission to access the spreadsheet
 *    - Solution: Make sure the script is in the same Google Drive as the spreadsheet
 * 
 * 3. CORS issues:
 *    - Cross-Origin Resource Sharing might be blocking the request
 *    - Solution: Add proper CORS headers to your script (already included)
 * 
 * 4. Data format issues:
 *    - The data might not be in the format the script expects
 *    - Solution: Check the format of the data being sent
